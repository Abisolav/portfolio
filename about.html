          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a passionate technical designer with a deep focus on user
            interface and user experience design. All of my recent work has
            centered around solving real problems through thoughtful,
            accessible, and intuitive design. I approach each project with
            curiosity, empathy, and a problem-solving mindset, always aiming to
            create digital experiences that feel meaningful and human.
          </p>

          <p>
            I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which gives me the
            ability to not only design interfaces but also understand and write
            the code that brings them to life. My technical background allows me
            to collaborate smoothly with developers, ensuring that every design
            decision is both visually compelling and technically feasible. As a
            technical designer, I bridge the gap between design and development
            ,speaking both languages fluently and turning ideas into usable,
            impactful products.
