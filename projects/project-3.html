          <h3 class="subheading">Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Calorie Creatures is a playful and motivational fitness app that
            transforms calories burned into points. The users use these points
            to hatch and collect virtual pets. Designed for casual movers and
            gym people, the app blends lighthearted visuals with real-world
            movement. It encourages users to stay active and track progress in a
            fun and rewarding way. The experience revolves around movement
            toreward mechanics, where every step, rep, or jump brings users
            closer to unlocking their next adorable companion.

            <h3 class="subheading">My Role</h3>
            <p>
              I created the unique pet silhouettes and final creature designs
              that serve as the heart of the experience. Each pet begins as a
              mystery egg, paired with an outline that sparks curiosity and
              motivates the user to earn points through physical activity. I
              developed the progression system from egg to fully revealed pet,
              ensuring a sense of anticipation and delight. Working closely with
              the coder, I also helped define the core creature-collection loop
              and visual feedback system that encourages daily engagement and
              movement tracking.

            <h3 class="subheading">Process</h3>
            <p>
              The design process began with user interviews and behavior mapping
              to understand what types of rewards motivate users in fitness
              apps. Early brainstorming sessions led to the egg and silhouette
              mechanic, which I illustrated through multiple concept sketches
              and mood boards. I iterated on over a dozen pet designs in
              Procreate and sketch, focusing on personality, cuteness, and
              variation. In parallel, I helped define the silhouette system to
              maintain mystery while giving just enough visual clues. Regular
              feedback from testers shaped the silhouettes‚Äô readability and the
              final pet animations, which were optimized for mobile
              responsiveness and emotional engagement.

            <h3 class="subheading">Key Features</h3>
            <p>
              Calorie Creatures turns calorie burn into tangible in-app
              progress. Each egg is paired with a silhouette of a surprise
              creature users must earn enough points to reveal and hatch it. The
              app uses daily movement data to drive progression, supporting a
              variety of activity types. Creatures range in rarity and design
              style, keeping the collection dynamic and exciting. The UI
              emphasizes accessibility and charm, while motivational prompts and
              milestones reinforce daily fitness habits. New pets are added
              regularly to encourage long-term use.

          <h3 class="subheading">Outcomes and Impact</h3>
          <p>
            TestFlight users reported increased daily movement and said the app
            made workouts ‚Äúfeel rewarding and fun.‚Äù The pet hatching system
            became a standout feature, with over 80% of users reaching at least
            one hatch goal in their first week. Feedback highlighted the
            creature design as ‚Äúcute and motivating,‚Äù and several beta testers
            said it helped them stick to consistent movement habits.

          <p>
            I plan to introduce seasonal level themes that refresh the visual
            palette throughout the year. I will experiment with subtle haptic
            feedback to make landings and power-up pickups feel even more
            satisfying. Finally, I am exploring an Android port utilizing
            Unity‚Äôs 2-D URP pipeline to reach a broader audience while
            maintaining the game‚Äôs visual and performance standards. Hopps
            stands as proof that tight mechanics, thoughtful art direction, and
            pragmatic engineering can coexist in a pocket-sized experience‚Äîand
            it remains a cornerstone of my technical-design portfolio.
