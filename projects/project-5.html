          <h3 class="subheading">Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Presently Yours was my entry for the Swift Student Challenge.
            Designed for anyone who struggles to communicate face to face, the
            app provides a safe, thoughtful space to record, save, and revisit
            heartfelt messages.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">My Role</h3>
          <p>
            I designed and built the entire prototype solo—creating a warm UI in
            Sketch &amp; Procreate and coding everything in SwiftUI with
            AVFoundation / AVFAudio. I also conducted accessibility and
            usability testing to ensure color-blind-friendly contrast and a
            stress-free flow.
          </p>

        <h3 class="subheading">Process</h3>
        <p>
          It started with really bad design due to broken code. the user testing
          with five target participants surfaced contrast issues that I
          corrected in later builds. After multiple polish passes texture
          compression tweaks, color grade adjustments, and input, the app was
          soft launched via TestFlight to gather telemetry and qualitative
          feedback.

          <h3 class="subheading">Key Features</h3>

            • Private voice-message recording without live-conversation pressure
          </p>
          <p>• Securely saved conversations users can revisit or send later</p>
          <p>• Gentle emotional prompts that help articulate feelings</p>
          <p>• Soothing, minimal visual design for calm reflection</p>
          <p>
            • Accessibility-focused UI (high contrast, dyslexia-friendly fonts,
            color-blind palettes)

        <h3 class="subheading">Outcomes and Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Testers called the app “therapeutic” and “emotionally freeing.” One
          remarked, “This is the first time I’ve ever said these words out loud,
          and it felt safe.” Presently Yours was featured in the 2025 Swift
          Student Challenge Showcase for blending empathy with solid technical
          execution.

        <p>
          I planned to updates and include optional message delivery, mood-based
          themes, and a text-journaling mode. These features will deepen user
          trust and broaden the ways people can share what matters.
