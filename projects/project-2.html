          <h3 class="subheading">Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Hopps is a fun and casual 2D vertical platformer designed for
            players who enjoys quick, engaging gameplay experiences. Inspired by
            games Celeste, Downwell and doodle Jump. Hopps brings a pixel-art
            and flat art aesthethic. Hopps is designed to be a simple yet
            challenging where players navigate vertically , dodging enemies,
            collecting power-ups, and striving for new high scores.

            <h3 class="subheading">My Role</h3>
            <p>
              As Game Designer and Systems Architect, I defined the scoring
              loop, tuned the difficulty ramp, and balanced power-ups to keep
              each run engaging without overwhelming new players. As UI/UX and
              Visual Designer, I produced an intuitive touch interface,
              established a cohesive visual language, and ensured that every
              color, icon, and type choice supported quick readability during
              play. As Character and Level Artist, I created all pixel sprites,
              tile sets, and layered parallax backgrounds in Procreate and
              Sketch, iterating until the art direction felt both playful and
              immediately legible on small screens. As Technical Implementer, I
              prototyped and shipped the codebase in Xcode’s SpriteKit,
              optimizing draw-call batching and texture-atlas packing to keep
              the final binary under 15 MB.

            <h3 class="subheading">Process</h3>
            <p>
              Research and Inspiration began with competitive analysis and
              mood-board creation, which clarified the core mechanic and
              aesthetic pillars. Concept Sketching transformed pencil wireframes
              into Figma flows, allowing early feedback on layout and navigation
              before any code was written. Rapid Prototyping delivered a
              playable vertical-climb demo after two sprints, validating the
              feel of jump arcs and enemy collisions. User Testing and Iteration
              involved five target players whose feedback highlighted contrast
              issues and control-placement pain points that were resolved in
              subsequent builds. Polish and Optimization followed, where
              texture-compression tweaks, color-grade adjustments, and
              input-latency reductions collectively boosted both performance and
              visual clarity. Launch and Review concluded the cycle with a
              TestFlight soft-launch that gathered telemetry and qualitative
              feedback, informing the current public build.

            <h3 class="subheading">Key Features</h3>
            <p>
              Hopps employs procedurally placed ledges to keep every ascent
              unpredictable and fresh. An adaptive difficulty system gradually
              increases enemy speed and platform spacing, ensuring that
              challenge scales with the player’s skill. The pixel / flat-art
              hybrid style maintains clarity even on smaller screens while
              delivering a memorable aesthetic signature. Seamless Game Center
              integration fuels friendly competition through global leaderboards
              and personal best tracking.

          <h3 class="subheading">Outcomes and Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Average session length increased by forty percent after the final UI
            and color-contrast refinements, demonstrating improved engagement.
            Texture-atlas repacking and draw-call consolidation reduced the app
            size by twenty-two percent without sacrificing visual fidelity.
            TestFlight users rate the game 4.6 / 5, frequently praising its
            “addictive loop” and “clean visuals.” Hopps was featured in the
            Academy Showcase 2024 as “Best Casual Mobile Prototype,”
            highlighting its success both as a design statement and a technical
            achievement.

          <h3 class="subheading">Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            I plan to introduce seasonal level themes that refresh the visual
            palette throughout the year. I will experiment with subtle haptic
            feedback to make landings and power-up pickups feel even more
            satisfying. Finally, I am exploring an Android port utilizing
            Unity’s 2-D URP pipeline to reach a broader audience while
            maintaining the game’s visual and performance standards. Hopps
            stands as proof that tight mechanics, thoughtful art direction, and
            pragmatic engineering can coexist in a pocket-sized experience—and
            it remains a cornerstone of my technical-design portfolio.
