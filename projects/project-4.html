          <h3 class="subheading">Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Hopps Alpha is the evolved version of the original Hopps. It's a
            vertical 2D platformer reimagined with a layered parallax world,
            infinite scrolling, and animated transitions that take the player
            from ground to galaxy. This updated version offers a more immersive
            visual experience and deeper player progression. Inspired by
            Celeste, Downwell, and Doodle Jump, Hopps Alpha combines intuitive
            controls with dynamic environments and unlockable character skins to
            keep players engaged through every climb.

            <h3 class="subheading">My Role</h3>
            <p>
              I directed the transformation from the original Hopps to Hopps
              Alpha. I redefined the visual theme and progression system to
              support the new world-to-space concept. I illustrated and animated
              the background parallax layers to create depth and motion. I
              implemented an endless scroll system for a continuous gameplay
              experience. I also worked on expanding character design, adding
              unlockable skins to personalize gameplay. My role included level
              theming, motion design, and performance optimization to ensure
              smooth transitions and efficient loading between zones.

            <h3 class="subheading">Process</h3>
            <p>
              We began by mapping the vertical journey across multiple visual
              zones, Earth, Sky, and Galaxy — and developed a parallax framework
              for each. I created modular background assets that animated
              independently, giving each stage a distinct sense of movement and
              place. We integrated sprite animations, transition effects, and
              randomized elements to make each session feel fresh. Weekly
              playtests helped us adjust visual speed, parallax depth, and
              animation pacing for a balance between aesthetics and clarity. I
              also tested different skin implementation systems and finalized a
              smooth unlock mechanism linked to in-game score milestones.

          <p>
            Blast into adventure, as you climb higher with each jump—your
            altitude and score unlock visually stunning new layers of the game
            world. As you ascend, the environment seamlessly transforms:
            platforms, backgrounds, and color palettes shift from urban skylines
            to galactic heights, creating a sense of momentum and wonder.
            Enemies feature dynamic omni-directional movement, adding an
            unpredictable challenge to every run and forcing players to react
            with precision and timing. Skins can be collected and worn in-game,
            allowing players to express themselves as they play.

          <h3 class="subheading">Outcomes and Impact</h3>
          <p>
            With 50 players and counting, a significant higher engagement was
            reported, with session times increasing by 75% compared to the
            original Hopps. The Visual updates like animated parallax, layers
            and unlockable skins were frequently praised in feedback, along with
            the seamless transition system. The performance remained stable
            despite added complexity, thanks to draw-call optimization and
            efficient sprite handling. Hopps Alpha was showcase at the 2025
            apple developper academy as one of the best casual game on the
            appstore.

          <p>
            Our next milestones include adding a wider variety of collectible
            skins, introducing new platform types and enemy behaviors to
            increase challenge and replayability, and designing additional game
            scene themes to enrich the vertical journey. We’re also exploring
            options to monetize the app responsibly, through optional cosmetic
            upgrades and rewards that enhance the experience without
            interrupting gameplay.
